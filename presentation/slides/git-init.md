##  git-init

As a first-time project lets version our dotfiles!

- Create the directory to version
- Initialize the git repository


    mkdir -p ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    git init .

We're all good citizens of the internet and want to document things right?

    echo "#Dotfiles \n These are my dotfiles" >> README.md



note:
    Put your speaker notes here.
    You can see them pressing 's'.

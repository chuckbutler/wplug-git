##  git-workflow

Files in git go through 4 stages in the workflow.

- **Untracked** - Git is unaware of these files

- **Modified** - Git knows its changed (its been added prior)

- **Staged** - The change is being added to the WIP commit

- **Committed** - Change is fully tracked and in the history


<p /><p />
**protip** - commit early commit often.

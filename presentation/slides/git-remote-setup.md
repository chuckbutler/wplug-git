##  Git Remote Setup

Now, we'll set up the remote in our repository, and publish our changes to the remote.

    git remote add origin https://github.com/wplug-user/dotfiles.git
    git push -u origin master

If you've got a repository with multiple remotes - you can always view them

    git remote -v

note:
    Put your speaker notes here.
    You can see them pressing 's'.

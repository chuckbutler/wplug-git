##  Git Branches

Git branches are the best way to fix things, add features, and keep your "dirty" work away from known "proven" work (which will live in master.)

    $ git branch
    * master

    $ git checkout -b add-aliases
    switched to a new branch 'add-aliases'

    $ git branch
    * add-aliases
      master

cheap copies enable exploration without much overhead

note:
    Put your speaker notes here.
    You can see them pressing 's'.

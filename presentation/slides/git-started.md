##  git-started

Git has GUI's but they can be extremely difficult to use without understanding the principals of what Git is doing under the hood. I recommend you spend at minimum a week using git from the CLI before you move on to using GUI tools.

Windows:
    
    http://git-scm.com/download/win

Mac:

    brew install git

Ubuntu / Fedora:

    apt-get install git
    (or)
    yum install git





note:
    Put your speaker notes here.
    You can see them pressing 's'.

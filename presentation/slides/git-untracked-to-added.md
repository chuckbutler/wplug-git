##  Adding Files

We need to Add our README.md to the version control history

    git add README.md

README.md is now 'staged' for a commit.

    $ git status

    Initial commit

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   README.md

Stages are not committed in the revison history.
Staging is useful when you've forgotten to commit early and commit often, you can stage a group of files pertaining to a particular change.


note:
    Put your speaker notes here.
    You can see them pressing 's'.
